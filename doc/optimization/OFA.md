# OFA (Once for All)

General Command Line Call for OFA is:

```shell
hannah-train --config-name nas_ofa
```

## Tests done with OFA

All the tests was run with the quantizized ofa model. Which could be found in `hannah/conf/model/ofa_quant.yaml`

During Ofa training, each random model are exported to a yaml config file. So that this model structure can be retrained from the beginning without having to use ofa. Thus the result of the ofa models can be compared 1 to 1 with those of the factory.

To do this, the exported models from `trained_models/nas_ofa/ofa/ofa_nas_dir/` must be copied to `hannah/conf/models/`
Afterwards the copied models can be trained with the factory.

The following code extracts all the accuracy from the multirun of the random models.

```python
import os

count = 100
output = "durchgang,Accuracy\n"

for i in range(count):
    filepath = str(i) + "/train.log"
    filecontent = None
    with open(filepath, "r") as f:
        filecontent = f.readlines()
    filecontent.reverse()
    for b in range(30):
        line = filecontent[b]
        if "test_accuracy" in line:
            break
    line = line.replace(" ","")
    line = line.replace("|test_accuracy|", "")
    index = line.find("|")
    accuracy = line[0:index]
    output += str(i)+ "," + str(accuracy) + "\n"



with open("output.csv", "w") as f:
    f.write(output)
```

To compare the data, the generated csv file and the csv file from ofa must be extended. All Bar charts and scatter Plots were created in excel with the data from the random test. The Ranking correlation errors were calculated with the same Data and the following Pytho Module [spearmanr](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html)

```python
result = scipy.stats.spearmanr(ofa, factory)
print("correlation: " + str(result.correlation))
```
