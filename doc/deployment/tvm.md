# TVM backend

A backend that runs the trained neural network through tvm with remote target support through automate.



## Configuration

val_batches
: 1 (number of batches used for validation)

test_batches
: 1 (number of batches used for test)

val_frequency
: 10 (run backend every n validation epochs)

board
: Target board configuration

tuner
: optional tuner configuration

### Board Configuration

#### MicroTVM connected boards or simulators
#### Automate connected Remote Boards

### Tuner

Autotuning is configure using the configuration group `backend/tuner`.

There are 3 predefined tuner configurations:

1. `Ã utotvm`

Uses the standard configuration for autotuning on the target board, it is generallly
the recommended setting for 8-bit quantized models on CPU like devices. As it allows the
targets to use hand defined tuning templates, which generally include tvm tuning templates.

2. `auto_scheduler`

Uses the standard tvm auto_scheduler. This scheduler does not support tensorization and is therefore not recommended on targets that support tensorized instructions. This is mostly the case for tensorized instructions on the target boards.

3. `baseline`

This does not use any tuning but uses the predefined schedules directly.


All tuner configurations are parametrizable using the following tuner configurations:
